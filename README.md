# RestauranTech

# Introduction
## The project
RestauranTech is a web application designed to optimize restaurant operations through advanced inventory management, cost control, and supplier price analysis. The app allows restaurants to manage the stock of ingredients, beverages, and other supplies in real-time, as well as monitor and control expenses related to purchases.
## Why was it made?
RestauranTech was made to help!
We are looking to aid:
* Restaurant owners and managers
* Restaurant administration staff
* Chefs and kitchen staff
* Suppliers and distributors

# Architecture
## Flask
For the web development part, we used the Flask framework to develop the web application.
## Wtforms
For the login forms and registration forms, using Wtforms was an optimal solution to capture information the user types in.
## werkzeug
To hash the password we used the werkzeug.security module, and implemented password salting.
## SQLAlchemy
For database management, SQLAlchemy is our best choice to manipulate SQL databases using Python language.

### Database
The database uses MySQL.
